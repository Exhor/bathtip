The 3D model of the BathTip sensor. A tactile sensor using a webcam and a piece of rubber. Idea based on the concept behind the <a href="http://www.brl.ac.uk/researchthemes/medicalrobotics/tactip.aspx">TacTip</a>, by BRL.

FCstd is a FreeCad file. It contains the 3D model for customisation, and an example of a base.

STL file is the file you need to print the sensor body.

Webcam for this design: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/eSecure-Microphone-Windows-Notebooks-Facebook/dp/B0041LK8NI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1409138411&sr=8-1&keywords=esecure+webcam">from amazon</a>

Rubber membrane can be cut out of a silicone baking tray, like <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Silicone-Bakeware-Chocolate-teacake-Fondant/dp/B00JH6MHIG/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1409137404&sr=8-1-spell&keywords=bombon+baking+tray+silicone">this one</a>.
